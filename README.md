# Rails Blog App

## Overview

This blog app was created as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Ruby on Rails curriculum.  It follows this [Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) guide provided by Rails.

[See the live version!](https://agile-plateau-43232.herokuapp.com/)  It has just enough styling to make it look like less of a tutorial.

## Learning Goals

1. Creating new Rails applications.
2. Identify the general layout of a Rails application.
3. Understand the basics of MVC and RESTful design.
4. Introduction to Heroku deployment.

## Final Thoughts
Going through this tutorial was very beneficial to make sense of material I had only read about prior to starting.  Rails does a lot of heavy lifting for us, so this was very good to get a little practice with finding the right locations for particular types of files and their interactions.  I also have a better understanding of MVC basics now that I've been able to touch each part.
